# Sign Language Translation Glove

A real-time sign language translation system based on ESP32-S3 that uses flex sensors, IMU, and machine learning to recognize sign language gestures and convert them to text and speech.

## Project Overview

This project implements a wearable glove that can:
- Detect finger positions using flex sensors
- Track hand movement and orientation using an IMU (MPU-6050)
- Process sensor data to recognize ASL signs
- Output translations via display, audio, and BLE to a mobile app
- Efficiently manage power for extended battery life

## Hardware Components

- ESP32-S3 microcontroller (dual-core with WiFi/BLE)
- 10x Spectra Symbol flex sensors (2 per finger)
- MPU-6050 6-axis IMU
- OV2640 camera module
- 0.96" OLED SSD1306 display
- MAX98357A I2S audio amplifier with speaker
- ERM vibration motor for haptic feedback
- LiPo battery with charging circuit

## Building and Flashing

1. Clone this repository:
   \`\`\`
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-glove.git
   cd sign-language-glove
   \`\`\`

2. Set up ESP-IDF environment:
   \`\`\`
   # Linux/macOS
   . $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
   
   # Windows
   %userprofile%\\esp\\esp-idf\\export.bat
   \`\`\`

3. Build the project:
   \`\`\`
   idf.py build
   \`\`\`

4. Flash to ESP32-S3:
   \`\`\`
   idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
   \`\`\`
   (Replace PORT with your ESP32-S3's serial port)

## Hardware Setup

Refer to the pin_definitions.h file for the GPIO pin assignments. The hardware connections are as follows:

- Flex sensors: ADC channels on GPIO1-10
- IMU: I2C bus (SDA: GPIO21, SCL: GPIO22)
- Display: I2C bus (shared with IMU)
- Camera: Dedicated pins on GPIO4-15
- Audio: I2S interface on GPIO25-27
- Haptic feedback: GPIO23

## Development Roadmap

1. Complete hardware driver implementations
2. Implement sensor fusion algorithms
3. Develop gesture recognition system
4. Optimize power management
5. Create mobile app for enhanced functionality
